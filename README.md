# Multilingual-Chatbot
# Description:

This project presents a versatile chatbot designed to assist university students, faculty, and staff. It leverages speech-to-text capabilities and advanced NLP techniques to provide a convenient and accessible way to interact with the university system. The chatbot offers high accuracy (around 96%) in understanding and responding to inquiries, making it a valuable resource for the university community.

# Key Features:

Speech-to-Text Support: Enables users to interact with the chatbot through voice commands, enhancing accessibility for those with visual impairments or who prefer hands-free communication.

Multilingual Support : Accommodates users with different Indian language preferences.

NLP Techniques: Employs tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and bag-of-words for robust text analysis.

Neural Network Model: Utilizes a neural network for predicting accurate and relevant responses based on user input.

University-Specific Focus: Tailored responses and information pertinent to university needs (e.g., course registration, deadlines, campus resources).

Graphical User Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface for those who prefer text-based interaction( Tkinter).

# Technologies Used:

Python

Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)

Keras

Tkinter 

# Pre-processing Steps:

Tokenization: Converts sentences into lists of words, removing whitespace and tabs.

Lowercasing: Normalizes case for consistent processing.

Stop Word Removal: Eliminates common, non-meaningful words (e.g., "the", "a").

Punctuation Removal: Focuses on word meaning rather than grammatical symbols.

Stemming/Lemmatization: Reduces words to their base forms.

# Neural Network Model:

Design and train a neural network architecture suitable for chatbot predictions (details vary based on implementation).

Consider using a pre-trained language model (e.g., BERT, BART) for advanced NLP capabilities.

# GUI :

Tkinter facilitates the creation of a user-friendly GUI for interacting with the chatbot.

Customize GUI elements (text boxes, buttons) as needed.
